## Antigenes and antibodies microbit program
This is a toy implementation I did with a microbit device.

## man
Use **A** and **B** buttons to move left and right in the main menu.
After you choosed your blood type:
-Touch **pin1** to scroll antibodies
-Touch **pin2** to scroll antigens
-Touch **pin0** for a smiley face :)

## todo
find a better way to iterate over a list
maybe a two-way circular list? Is that a thing?
too lazy for this
